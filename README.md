# The Ansberry Project
*Good morning sir, how would you like your tea?*

Ansberry is a project attempting to build a modular smarthouse ecosystem through a collection of common conventions. These conventions can then be used to implement microservices and devices that can fit into the system perfectly.

The project is in a very early state.

The current plan for an Ansberry estate would be as follows:
- Headmaster (service manager)
- Telephone (message broadcaster)
- (no name) (network action abstraction)
- Courtyard (optional, gateway to internet)
- Ansberry (personal assistant, personality)
	- (vocal interface)
	- TTS API
- Dashboard (pending rename)
- Other services and devices, potentially including:
	- Lighting
	- Speakers
	- Microphone interface
	- Reminder system
	- Coffee Pot, Oven, Microwave, Toaster
